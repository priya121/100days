      <div data-id="content"><p>Static methods in java are used when the method needs to be called without creating an object of the class.</p><p>An instance variable needs an object to be created for it to be called whereas a static method does not. That is why most main classes in java must be static.</p><p>Static methods typically take all their data from their parameters and create something from those parameters. They also typically have no reference to variables, so can handle generic calculations well.</p><p>It is possible to make many methods static, but this is bad practice as it is unclear as to what the responsibility of the class is when many methods can be called on it that are not necssarily related to what it does. A static method called on a class is also not polymorpic so this means that it is not possible to override the behavior set by a static method.</p><p>So it is important to think carefully when creating a static method and avoid using them unless necessary.</p></div>
