      <div data-id="content"><p>Constructing tests and deciding where to start is difficult, especially at the very beginning. A useful place to start is the most basic use case, an empty array or string representing the final construction you want to start building. This is a good entry point and from there you can start building out what you want to construct step by step, closer to the final product.</p><p>A good practice, that is difficult to adpot, is to think about what your code would ideally look like on execution and write a test that reflects this. This is of course more difficult than you would imagine. Most of the time, even before a test has been written you have some idea of how you want to di this in code. I think it is a good idea to try and detach and try on just focus on the tests and go from there. This is something I know I definitely need to work on.</p></div>
