        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>There are many useful components in Ruby as a language and one I looked into closer recently is Encapsulation.</p><p>Encapsulation reduces coupling as it hides the internal representation or data structure of a particular object. This makes it easier to make changes when they become necessary, as if there are changes that need to be made to the data within the class, it will handle these changes and they will not have to be made throughout the entire program or application. </p><p>Encapsulation makes more sense when programs get larger, but I am going to try and implement it as soon as possible and this will make things easier to change.</p></section>

        <h1><a data-id="page-link" href="../../enums.html">Enums in Java</a></h1>
        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Enums in Java allow for a specific data type to be set as a list of predefined constants. Most of the time, these predefined constants represent constants in the real world, like days of the week or months in a year. These rarely change so can be set for the duration of a program and do not represent numeric values or textual data.</p><p>Enums in Java are type safe, meaning that they cannot be reassigned to another type once they have been set. It is also possible to set values for the enums and retrieve these by calling .values() on them.</p><p>They can be used somewhat recklessly when defining a type on a set of values, but used well can be useful.</p></section>

        <h1><a data-id="page-link" href="../../exceptions.html"> Throwing Exceptions</a></h1>
        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Throwing an exception is a way of handling an error that a method may produce for a specific reason that was expected by the programmer who wrote it.</p><p>In java a complier will not let you compile a method if an exception is written that has not been handled or specifically declared.</p><p>Even though it is possible to declare that the main method throws the exception, it is always nicer to pass the declaration to another method and print a message to the user after another method has caught the exception. It is also good practice to tell the user how to address the error if at all possible.</p></section>

        <section data-id="content"><p>Everything has to be explicitly declared in Java. I am starting to get used to it, even though the format looks different, the general structure of a class is not too different to Ruby, even though there are a lot of restrictions on what you can and cannot do.</p><p>In order to use Input Output in Java, the simplest way to do this is the InputStreamReader and OutputStreamReader.</p><p>The sytnax for these is System.in and System.out.print() respectively, but the format of these has to be changed accordingly when a certain type of display is needed.</p><p>It is also possible to use the Scanner class that parses primitive types and strings suing regular expressions.</p><p>There are so many tools and libraries that you can import in java that help you, it can be difficult to figure out which ones are best to use, but I am sure this is something that comes with practice and familiarity with the language.</p></section>
