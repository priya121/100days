        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">02 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Throwing an exception is a way of handling an error that a method may produce for a specific reason that was expected by the programmer who wrote it.</p><p>In java a complier will not let you compile a method if an exception is written that has not been handled or specifically declared.</p><p>Even though it is possible to declare that the main method throws the exception, it is always nicer to pass the declaration to another method and print a message to the user after another method has caught the exception. It is also good practice to tell the user how to address the error if at all possible.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">04 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Everything has to be explicitly declared in Java. I am starting to get used to it, even though the format looks different, the general structure of a class is not too different to Ruby, even though there are a lot of restrictions on what you can and cannot do.</p><p>In order to use Input Output in Java, the simplest way to do this is the InputStreamReader and OutputStreamReader.</p><p>The sytnax for these is System.in and System.out.print() respectively, but the format of these has to be changed accordingly when a certain type of display is needed.</p><p>It is also possible to use the Scanner class that parses primitive types and strings suing regular expressions.</p><p>There are so many tools and libraries that you can import in java that help you, it can be difficult to figure out which ones are best to use, but I am sure this is something that comes with practice and familiarity with the language.</p></section>

        <h1><a data-id="page-link" href="../../interfaces.html">Interfaces</a></h1>
        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">10 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Interfaces are a set of classes that used to create an abstraction between two other related classes. They do not contain any new code but hold behaviours and method signatures and should be abstract classes with abstract names.</p><p>The advantage of using interfaces is that they help eliminate unnecessary dependencies that create rigid and fragile software. Adding interfaces hides the implementation of certain classes from others when they are not needed and allows for easier changes to the code later down the line.</p><p>Ruby and other dynamic languages do not need to have an explicit interface class, but it is necessary to define an interface class type explicitly for statically typed languages like Java.</p></section>

        <h1><a data-id="page-link" href="../../java.html">Java</a></h1>
        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">20 August 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language and it takes some getting used to when moving across from Ruby. This basically means that types have to be defined when you initially set them and cannot be changed at a later stage in an application or program. </p><p>This makes it more clear as to what is happening and provides more structure as less is hidden. The length of methods and simple statements are also therefore much longer than Ruby.</p><p>The Java koans are a good starting point and introduce basic Java tools (some used frequently and others not so much), but getting used to writing in a new language is the best way to learn it.</p></section>
