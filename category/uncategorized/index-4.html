        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Stacks are a pretty fundamental concept in CS. They represent how data is allocated to memory at a basic level. A stack area on computer memory is of a fixed origin and variable size. The two basic operations that are used most frequently on a stack is inserting an item and removing an item and a stack uses the concept of last in first out (LIFO). In Java it is possible to create a Stack and call certain predefined methods on it like push, pop, peek, search and size. Like most Java lists a stack has to contain matching objects within it that must be declared when it is first created.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Something I am getting used to while learning Java is Type Casting. Type Casting is the assignment of one type of variable to another type.</p><p>There are two different types of Type Casting in Java. The widening casting from byte up to double, including everything in between (these take up increasing amounts of memory) and narrowing casting (a decreasing amount of memory) from double down to byte, also including everything in between.</p><p>It is important that the type cast objects share the same type hierarchy, meaning that they have a parent child relationship between them. If this is not the case, the compiler will throw a ClassCastException. Narrowing casting needs to be explicitly set in that you need to be explicit in the type of casting required. </p><p>Type casting is mainly used to get access to fields and methods declared on a target type or class and I am sure I will be using more of them as I get more familiar with Java.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Why Java functions the way it does becomes clearer once the way the Java memory model is understood. I’m sure I’ve only scratched the surface but here is a little of what I have learnt so far.</p><p>The memory model dictates how the virtual memory model interacts with the computer memory (RAM).</p><p>The Java memory model splits memory used by a Java application between thread stacks and the heap. Which of these is used depends on the type defined. Primitive types are stored on the thread stacks and objects or references to those objects are stored on the heap stack.</p><p>If there are multiple variables representing primitive types, these can be stored as separate items on different thread stacks as copies of the original type.</p><p>Using primitive types increases the speed of an application despite the fact that creating Objects references can be easier to use, so I am going to try and use primitive types when it makes sense to do so.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>UML diagrams are commonly used when modelling for object oriented design programs. They are the graphical notation for drawing diagrams of software concepts.</p><p>Composite relationships are shown in a UML diagram by an arrow with one end a point and the other a diamond.</p><p>Inheritance is shown through a blank arrowhead and the arrows point in the direction that the inheritance flows from.</p><p>Class Icons are divided into three components, a class title, the variables and the functions and interfaces are shown by the &lt;&gt; notation.</p><p>It is always a good idea to draw up a UML before starting to write a program, and adjust it as you go.</p></section>
