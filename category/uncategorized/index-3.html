        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Interfaces are a set of classes that used to create an abstraction between two other related classes. They do not contain any new code but hold behaviours and method signatures and should be abstract classes with abstract names.</p><p>The advantage of using interfaces is that they help eliminate unnecessary dependencies that create rigid and fragile software. Adding interfaces hides the implementation of certain classes from others when they are not needed and allows for easier changes to the code later down the line.</p><p>Ruby and other dynamic languages do not need to have an explicit interface class, but it is necessary to define an interface class type explicitly for statically typed languages like Java.</p></section>

        <h1><a data-id="page-link" href="../../java.html">Java</a></h1>
        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language and it takes some getting used to when moving across from Ruby. This basically means that types have to be defined when you initially set them and cannot be changed at a later stage in an application or program. </p><p>This makes it more clear as to what is happening and provides more structure as less is hidden. The length of methods and simple statements are also therefore much longer than Ruby.</p><p>The Java koans are a good starting point and introduce basic Java tools (some used frequently and others not so much), but getting used to writing in a new language is the best way to learn it.</p></section>

        <h1><a data-id="page-link" href="../../katas.html">Katas</a></h1>
        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Coding Katas are a way of practicing muscle memory and approaching a simple problem in the simplest way possible. I have not attempted too many katas so far, but intend to do as many as I can going forwards. Two that I have approached are the roman numerals kata and the coin changer kata. The more you practice them the easier they become.</p><p>I am going to attempt to at least start one every morning. <a href="http://exercism.io/">This</a> is a great website that has a long list of different katas in different languages and the well-known <a href="http://www.codewars.com/about">CodeWars</a> is another that is fun and easy to use.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Loops in Java are useful even in the most simple program and contain their contents within curly braces. The two most common ones I have used so far are the for loop;</p><p>eg. for( int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++ )</p><p>and the while loop;</p><p>eg. while ( i &lt; number.length )</p><p>Keeping track of the variables and loops can again be clarified through the use of an instruction tab.</p><p>It is also possible to escape out of a loop if a certain condition is met using a label just before the beginning of the loop and a break after the end of the loop.</p></section>

        <h1><a data-id="page-link" href="../../method_signatures_in_java.html">Method Signatures in Java</a></h1>
        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">22 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>The main class in java must be present in the application at least once for it to be able to run and has a pretty standard signature.</p><p>Methods in java have to have certain elements in order for the Java package to be able to collect the parts of the program togethr and process them in a logical way.</p><p>Firstly a method must be public or private. Public means that it is available across packages whereas private means it is only accessible within the current package. Then if a method is static(that is, it is not called by Objects within the class) this must also be part of the method signature.</p><p>These are followed by what the method signature will return (String, Integer, String[], void etc.) and the method name.</p><p>In Java if a method takes an arguement, the type of arguement must also be declared within parentheses, this is true even if the method takes no arguement with the parentheses being left blank.</p><p>Method signatures in Java seem complicated at first, but I have been told that this makes things clearer in the long term, so far most of my programs and tasks have been small, but I will report back when I know if this is true.</p></section>
