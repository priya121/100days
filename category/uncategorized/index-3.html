        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">21 August 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Coding Katas are a way of practicing muscle memory and approaching a simple problem in the simplest way possible. I have not attempted too many katas so far, but intend to do as many as I can going forwards. Two that I have approached are the roman numerals kata and the coin changer kata. The more you practice them the easier they become.</p><p>I am going to attempt to at least start one every morning. <a href="http://exercism.io/">This</a> is a great website that has a long list of different katas in different languages and the well-known <a href="http://www.codewars.com/about">CodeWars</a> is another that is fun and easy to use.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">08 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Loops in Java are useful even in the most simple program and contain their contents within curly braces. The two most common ones I have used so far are the for loop;</p><p>eg. for( int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++ )</p><p>and the while loop;</p><p>eg. while ( i &lt; number.length )</p><p>Keeping track of the variables and loops can again be clarified through the use of an instruction tab.</p><p>It is also possible to escape out of a loop if a certain condition is met using a label just before the beginning of the loop and a break after the end of the loop.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">07 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>The single responsibility principle means that a class should only have one reason to change.</p><p>The idea is that each class should only have one role or handle one piece of behaviour. This does not mean that each class should contain one method, but if when describing a class behaviour, the word and is used then it is quite likely that the class is doing too much and the additional behaviour should be split out.</p><p>If the SRP is implemented well, then the design of the program will be more flexible and easier to change.</p><p>This is because if a class changes then only the class that handles that behaviour will have to change and the code will not be too coupled–meaning that one small change that must be made leads to numerous other things being forced to change.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">28 August 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Something I am getting used to while learning Java is Type Casting. Type Casting is the assignment of one type of variable to another type.</p><p>There are two different types of Type Casting in Java. The widening casting from byte up to double, including everything in between (these take up increasing amounts of memory) and narrowing casting (a decreasing amount of memory) from double down to byte, also including everything in between.</p><p>It is important that the type cast objects share the same type hierarchy, meaning that they have a parent child relationship between them. If this is not the case, the compiler will throw a ClassCastException. Narrowing casting needs to be explicitly set in that you need to be explicit in the type of casting required. </p><p>Type casting is mainly used to get access to fields and methods declared on a target type or class and I am sure I will be using more of them as I get more familiar with Java.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">03 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>UML diagrams are commonly used when modelling for object oriented design programs. They are the graphical notation for drawing diagrams of software concepts.</p><p>Composite relationships are shown in a UML diagram by an arrow with one end a point and the other a diamond.</p><p>Inheritance is shown through a blank arrowhead and the arrows point in the direction that the inheritance flows from.</p><p>Class Icons are divided into three components, a class title, the variables and the functions and interfaces are shown by the &lt;&gt; notation.</p><p>It is always a good idea to draw up a UML before starting to write a program, and adjust it as you go.</p></section>
