        <div data-id="content"><p>Because Java is so statically typed, it is useful to know what the right data structure to use before using it. In Ruby I used Arrays for almost all lists that I was creating. In Java, my go to is an ArrayList, but recently I used a HashMap when trying to build a Histogram for a simple Kata. Having restrictions on the data types you can use and what methods you can call on them is something I think will have more utility when I build larger programs. Something I probably should brush up on then is data structures and their uses. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I have tried to do when writing a program, even when it is very small is not absracting out classes too early. However, I may fall into the trap of not extracting them out even when I need to. A sign that a class should be abstracted is that there is a variable being constructed in the class that should really only be a concern of a specific method. This is how the Single Responsibility Principle starts to apply and the questions that need to be asked–what is this class doing? comes in handy. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I do not actively think about is the memory that a program takes up when it runs. This is something that I am aware of, but my main concern is that the code works. I am starting to see that unnecessary calls lead to slow running programs and this is probably a factor that I should start considering. The simplest way to do this is to reduce the method calls a class makes if at all possible. In my minesweeper game I had 3 calls to get input from the user when this could have been saved as a single variable and reused. So this is something I will try and keep in mind as I start extracting out classes and trying to speed up the code that I am writing. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I was getting comfortable with in Ruby was deciding which objects should be separate and starting to sense what they should and should not be doing. This was probably because I had built a few games and was starting to see the pattern of what should be separated out. </p><p>It is strange that when the syntax for something is new even though the objects they represent might not be so different, it feels strange to think about how they should be separated out. Hopefully, with a bit of practice this will again start to become clear and the more I write, the clearer it will become.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>So last time I wrote about Git Pull requests, I more or less covered the basics and had not really made any practical requests. I had just made one basic one without any messages or meaningful pieces of code. Something the other apprentices and I are trying to do more of is reviewing each others code and so I tried making some pull requests today. I created multiple branches and somehow managed to delete my master branch when trying to use git with Intellij, but I finally managed to make a pull request with a little piece of code and functionality that could be read easily by someone. And I was able to make changes that helped me a lot.</p><p>I am still making some formatting and whitespace errors that I am still working on, but I think I am getting the hang of it. I am going to try and use pull requests and make them as frequently as possible now, so I can maybe get some feedback as I go and not fall into bad habits.</p></div>
