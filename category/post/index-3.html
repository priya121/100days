        <div data-id="content"><p>The single responsibility principle means that a class should only have one reason to change.</p><p>The idea is that each class should only have one role or handle one piece of behaviour. This does not mean that each class should contain one method, but if when describing a class behaviour, the word and is used then it is quite likely that the class is doing too much and the additional behaviour should be split out.</p><p>If the SRP is implemented well, then the design of the program will be more flexible and easier to change.</p><p>This is because if a class changes then only the class that handles that behaviour will have to change and the code will not be too coupled–meaning that one small change that must be made leads to numerous other things being forced to change.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Loops in Java are useful even in the most simple program and contain their contents within curly braces. The two most common ones I have used so far are the for loop;</p><p>eg. for( int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++ )</p><p>and the while loop;</p><p>eg. while ( i &lt; number.length )</p><p>Keeping track of the variables and loops can again be clarified through the use of an instruction tab.</p><p>It is also possible to escape out of a loop if a certain condition is met using a label just before the beginning of the loop and a break after the end of the loop.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>UML diagrams are commonly used when modelling for object oriented design programs. They are the graphical notation for drawing diagrams of software concepts.</p><p>Composite relationships are shown in a UML diagram by an arrow with one end a point and the other a diamond.</p><p>Inheritance is shown through a blank arrowhead and the arrows point in the direction that the inheritance flows from.</p><p>Class Icons are divided into three components, a class title, the variables and the functions and interfaces are shown by the &lt;&gt; notation.</p><p>It is always a good idea to draw up a UML before starting to write a program, and adjust it as you go.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>Interfaces are a set of classes that used to create an abstraction between two other related classes. They do not contain any new code but hold behaviours and method signatures and should be abstract classes with abstract names.</p><p>The advantage of using interfaces is that they help eliminate unnecessary dependencies that create rigid and fragile software. Adding interfaces hides the implementation of certain classes from others when they are not needed and allows for easier changes to the code later down the line.</p><p>Ruby and other dynamic languages do not need to have an explicit interface class, but it is necessary to define an interface class type explicitly for statically typed languages like Java.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>Why Java functions the way it does becomes clearer once the way the Java memory model is understood. I’m sure I’ve only scratched the surface but here is a little of what I have learnt so far.</p><p>The memory model dictates how the virtual memory model interacts with the computer memory (RAM).</p><p>The Java memory model splits memory used by a Java application between thread stacks and the heap. Which of these is used depends on the type defined. Primitive types are stored on the thread stacks and objects or references to those objects are stored on the heap stack.</p><p>If there are multiple variables representing primitive types, these can be stored as separate items on different thread stacks as copies of the original type.</p><p>Using primitive types increases the speed of an application despite the fact that creating Objects references can be easier to use, so I am going to try and use primitive types when it makes sense to do so.</p></div>
