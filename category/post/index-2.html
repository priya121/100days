        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I am getting used to while learning Java is Type Casting. Type Casting is the assignment of one type of variable to another type.</p><p>There are two different types of Type Casting in Java. The widening casting from byte up to double, including everything in between (these take up increasing amounts of memory) and narrowing casting (a decreasing amount of memory) from double down to byte, also including everything in between.</p><p>It is important that the type cast objects share the same type hierarchy, meaning that they have a parent child relationship between them. If this is not the case, the compiler will throw a ClassCastException. Narrowing casting needs to be explicitly set in that you need to be explicit in the type of casting required. </p><p>Type casting is mainly used to get access to fields and methods declared on a target type or class and I am sure I will be using more of them as I get more familiar with Java.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Enums in Java allow for a specific data type to be set as a list of predefined constants. Most of the time, these predefined constants represent constants in the real world, like days of the week or months in a year. These rarely change so can be set for the duration of a program and do not represent numeric values or textual data.</p><p>Enums in Java are type safe, meaning that they cannot be reassigned to another type once they have been set. It is also possible to set values for the enums and retrieve these by calling .values() on them.</p><p>They can be used somewhat recklessly when defining a type on a set of values, but used well can be useful.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Arrays in Ruby are incredibly useful and most of the tasks and programs that I built while I was learning Ruby had an array within them at some point or another. As I learn more Java I’m sure that arrays will be increasingly useful, (I have already used some briefly in some of the katas that I am practicing).</p><p>Arrays in Java must be created using an array creation expression. </p><p>e.g. new type[length] </p><p>The type must be explicitly set as everything must be in Java. Similar to Ruby different elements can be accessed using array[i] where i is the index number of the element trying to be accessed.</p><p>It is also possible to create multi-dimensional arrays by writing type [] [], type [] [] [] etc.</p><p>There are also no array constants, new arrays are created every time an array initialiser is evaluated. </p><p>Despite there being these restrictions on arrays in Java, by using class Arrays in java.util certain utility methods are available that allow you manipulate the array.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>Throwing an exception is a way of handling an error that a method may produce for a specific reason that was expected by the programmer who wrote it.</p><p>In java a complier will not let you compile a method if an exception is written that has not been handled or specifically declared.</p><p>Even though it is possible to declare that the main method throws the exception, it is always nicer to pass the declaration to another method and print a message to the user after another method has caught the exception. It is also good practice to tell the user how to address the error if at all possible.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Everything has to be explicitly declared in Java. I am starting to get used to it, even though the format looks different, the general structure of a class is not too different to Ruby, even though there are a lot of restrictions on what you can and cannot do.</p><p>In order to use Input Output in Java, the simplest way to do this is the InputStreamReader and OutputStreamReader.</p><p>The sytnax for these is System.in and System.out.print() respectively, but the format of these has to be changed accordingly when a certain type of display is needed.</p><p>It is also possible to use the Scanner class that parses primitive types and strings suing regular expressions.</p><p>There are so many tools and libraries that you can import in java that help you, it can be difficult to figure out which ones are best to use, but I am sure this is something that comes with practice and familiarity with the language.</p></div>
