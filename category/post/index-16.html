        <div data-id="content"><p>So much in coding (and in life really!) is about trade offs. There are so many ways to do the same thing when you write code that most of the time there are a lot of advantages and disadvantage to doing the same thing. </p><p>I suppose that is why everyone in the coding community seems to be so opinionated about what they believe is the optimal way to do something. I am still forming my opinions about the tools and approaches I am learning. </p><p>I am sure once I learn the restrictions and frustrations of using a tool in a real world environment I’ll form some stronger opinions about what I prefer but right now I can see the trade offs for most approaches and think you can probably find a use for most tools depending on the job.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>A static method or vaiable is one that does not belong to a particular object but to a class. There are a few reasons for doing this. You may want to keep track of how many objects of a certain type ofe class are created, or assign an id to each object created or just access a variable from outside the class. It is possible to then access the static, constant from outside the class, but in order to make it unchangable it is necessary to also declare it final.</p><p>It is convention to write constants in capitals. They will still work as expected if this is not done, but doing this means that it is clear to anyone reading your code that the variable is a constant.</p><p>I have tended to avoid using constants, but I am going to try and introduce them wherever necessary in my Java TicTacToe.</p></div>
