        <div data-id="content"><p>The main class in java must be present in the application at least once for it to be able to run and has a pretty standard signature.</p><p>Methods in java have to have certain elements in order for the Java package to be able to collect the parts of the program togethr and process them in a logical way.</p><p>Firstly a method must be public or private. Public means that it is available across packages whereas private means it is only accessible within the current package. Then if a method is static(that is, it is not called by Objects within the class) this must also be part of the method signature.</p><p>These are followed by what the method signature will return (String, Integer, String[], void etc.) and the method name.</p><p>In Java if a method takes an arguement, the type of arguement must also be declared within parentheses, this is true even if the method takes no arguement with the parentheses being left blank.</p><p>Method signatures in Java seem complicated at first, but I have been told that this makes things clearer in the long term, so far most of my programs and tasks have been small, but I will report back when I know if this is true.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Stacks are a pretty fundamental concept in CS. They represent how data is allocated to memory at a basic level. A stack area on computer memory is of a fixed origin and variable size. The two basic operations that are used most frequently on a stack are inserting an item and removing an item. A stack uses the concept of last in first out (LIFO) as opposed to a queue which uses the concept of (FIFO). In Java it is possible to create a stack and call certain predefined methods on it like push, pop, peek, search and size. Like most Java lists a stack has to contain matching objects within it that must be declared when it is first created.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Mathematics is not vital to knowing how to program, but it definitely helps if you are good at it. This is formal logic. If x then y is not the same as if y then x (a mistake people make all the time in everyday conversation). Counting in binary is simple if you imagine that all a computer has access to is 0 and 1 or on and off in an electrical circuit.</p><p>Because of this everything it reads has to be repreeneted in 0s and 1s. So this means that once it has used 0 and 1 to represent a number it can repetitively reuse 0 and 1 to add onto the end of a previous combination of 0 and 1. </p><p>This is best explained if you imagine that you can only count using the digits 0–10 and a–j once you have counted to 10 using the numbers in order to carry on 0a would represent 11 and 1a would be 21 etc. </p><p>In a similar way a computer uses 0s and 1s and combinations of these when it needs to add to a previous value.</p><p>The easiest way to calculate the binary value of a number is to divide a number by 2 and record the remainder value as part of the binary result until the number you are dividing is one.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>While and Do While loops are two of the most common loops and they exist across most languages. A normal while loop executes the code inside it provided the boolean expression it evaluates is true.</p><p>It is easy to enter a never ending while loop accidently if you forget to include a terminating condition. So it is important to always consider if the condition that you want to exit the loop on is ever met. If it is not your program will never exit the loop or go past that point.</p><p>eg.</p><pre><code>while (true) 
    do (something)
 until (terminating condition)
</code></pre><p>A do while loop however, is that the code is always executed at least once, because the condition or expression is evaluated at the bottom of the loop. </p><p>This is an advantage in certain circumstances eg. if you need to make sure an output is printed at least once even if the condition within the while loop is not true.</p><p>So next time you want to use a while loop, it is worth thinking about if it would make more sense to use a do while loop.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language, which means that every variable and every expression has a type that must be known at compile time.</p><p>Types limit the values a variable can hold or an expression can produce, but also help reduce errors in the long run.</p><p>So in Java, data is stored in the form of data types and every variable has a data type.</p><p>The data types in Java are split into two :-</p><p>primitive data types and object types/references</p><p>PRIMITIVE TYPES</p><p>The Java memory model specifies how the Java virtual machine works with the computer memory (RAM).</p><p>The value of a variable stored as a primitive type is typically stored in the memory location assigned to that variable on the thread stack</p><p>There are 8–predefined primitive by the language, here they are in order of increasing sizes and they are limited to those sizes:</p><p>“primitive” means a fundamental component that is used to create other, larger parts</p><p>When you create variable stored as a primitive type instead of creating an object on the heap, Java creates a kind of automatic variable that is not a reference. This variable holds the value directly and is placed on the stack making access more efficient.</p><p>int x = 3; &gt; this means at the memory location of x, 3 will be stored there</p><p>Primitive types also come in versions that are objects. Just capitalised and these have their own set of methods that can be called on them.</p><p>OBJECT TYPES</p><p>A variable of an object type is also called a reference. This is because the variable doesn’t contain the object, but contains a reference pointing to the object. These are stored in the heap.</p><p>The different object types in java are :</p><p>interface types, class types and array types</p><p>In order to create an object reference you must instantiate an object first so that you can manipulate it. So you don’t manipulate the object directly, but use a reference to the object. The reference to the object is like a remote control to the actual object the TV. So you can access the object by calling certain methods on the reference.</p><p>When you create an object in Java, it is stored on the heap. There is generally no limit to memory size in this area. To create an object on the heap, you would use the new keyword like this:-</p><p>eg. Integer myInteger = new Integer(45);</p><p>MEMORY MODEL</p><p>Primitive types and object types are stored within the Java Memory Model</p><p>A local variable (one not accessible by the class) may be of a primitive type, in which case it is kept on the thread stack.</p><p>A local variable may also be a reference to an object. In that case the reference (the local variable) is stored on the thread stack, but the object itself if stored on the heap.</p><p>An object may contain methods and these methods may contain local variables. These local variables are also stored on the thread stack.</p><p>The member variables of an object however, are stored on the heap along with the object itself. That is true both when the member variable is of a primitive type, and if it is a reference to an object. The heap contains all objects created in your Java application, regardless of what thread created the object.</p><p>AUTOBOXING</p><p>Before Java 5 you had to call a method on an object version of a primitive type in order to get the value</p><p>But with Java 5, Java automatically converts a primitive type like int into corresponding wrapper class object and unwraps an object if a primitive type is required</p><p>eg. ArrayList intList = new ArrayList(); intList.add(1); //autoboxing–primitive to object</p><p>int number = intList.get(0); // unboxing–object to primitive</p><p>Need to be careful, if you try to convert null to a primitive value you will get a NullPointerException</p><p>Integer myInteger = null; int myInt = myInteger;</p><p>Using operators and comparing values, and can also lead to unnecessary memory use.</p></div>
