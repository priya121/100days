      <div data-id="content"><p>When I first heard about code retreats I thought a holiday or trip was involved at some point. I suppose that was the original idea, that people would go and meet each other at a specific location and code together.</p><p>I took part in my first code retreat today and it was really fun! The retrospectives about what has been learnt is particularly interesting, but the part I enjoyed was working with people and seeing how they approach the specific problem, especially when it is so different to mine.</p><p>I saw how some people communicate through narration, others let code do the talking and others ask questions. I was even exposed to a new language and had to be quiet for a full 20 minutes when trying to complete a specific task with my pair, which was a struggle.</p><p>We had 20 minute iterations, or pairing sessions with a specific constraint and this made the challenges difficult, but it was a great way to get some exposure to a code retreat in a short space of time.</p><p>I am looking forward to my next one!</p></div>
