        <div data-id="content"><p>Interfaces are a set of classes that used to create an abstraction between two other related classes. They do not contain any new code but hold behaviours and method signatures and should be abstract classes with abstract names.</p><p>The advantage of using interfaces is that they help eliminate unnecessary dependencies that create rigid and fragile software. Adding interfaces hides the implementation of certain classes from others when they are not needed and allows for easier changes to the code later down the line.</p><p>Ruby and other dynamic languages do not need to have an explicit interface class, but it is necessary to define an interface class type explicitly for statically typed languages like Java.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>UML diagrams are commonly used when modelling for object oriented design programs. They are the graphical notation for drawing diagrams of software concepts.</p><p>Composite relationships are shown in a UML diagram by an arrow with one end a point and the other a diamond.</p><p>Inheritance is shown through a blank arrowhead and the arrows point in the direction that the inheritance flows from.</p><p>Class Icons are divided into three components, a class title, the variables and the functions and interfaces are shown by the &lt;&gt; notation.</p><p>It is always a good idea to draw up a UML before starting to write a program, and adjust it as you go.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Loops in Java are useful even in the most simple program and contain their contents within curly braces. The two most common ones I have used so far are the for loop;</p><p>eg. for( int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++ )</p><p>and the while loop;</p><p>eg. while ( i &lt; number.length )</p><p>Keeping track of the variables and loops can again be clarified through the use of an instruction tab.</p><p>It is also possible to escape out of a loop if a certain condition is met using a label just before the beginning of the loop and a break after the end of the loop.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>The single responsibility principle means that a class should only have one reason to change.</p><p>The idea is that each class should only have one role or handle one piece of behaviour. This does not mean that each class should contain one method, but if when describing a class behaviour, the word and is used then it is quite likely that the class is doing too much and the additional behaviour should be split out.</p><p>If the SRP is implemented well, then the design of the program will be more flexible and easier to change.</p><p>This is because if a class changes then only the class that handles that behaviour will have to change and the code will not be too coupled–meaning that one small change that must be made leads to numerous other things being forced to change.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Everything has to be explicitly declared in Java. I am starting to get used to it, even though the format looks different, the general structure of a class is not too different to Ruby, even though there are a lot of restrictions on what you can and cannot do.</p><p>In order to use Input Output in Java, the simplest way to do this is the InputStreamReader and OutputStreamReader.</p><p>The sytnax for these is System.in and System.out.print() respectively, but the format of these has to be changed accordingly when a certain type of display is needed.</p><p>It is also possible to use the Scanner class that parses primitive types and strings suing regular expressions.</p><p>There are so many tools and libraries that you can import in java that help you, it can be difficult to figure out which ones are best to use, but I am sure this is something that comes with practice and familiarity with the language.</p></div>
