Previously I was so focused on getting my code to work as quickly as possible, I did not spend as much time as I should have naming as best as I could. </p><p>I am also working on separating out methods that only handle one piece of behaviour. Some of the other apprentices and I are going to start reviewing each others code and making regular pull requests so the readability of the code is going to be increasingly important.</p><p>Of all the various components of good clean code, naming is probably the most important so I am going to do my best to make mine as easy to decipher as possible.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I am still learning the optimal way to break a problem down. This is something I think I will gain a huge benefit from. I realised that there is a level of granularity that I am not used to with some problems, but I am getting better at it. I need to not only know the steps of the general problem, but also the best way of breaking these down into methods and the best data structures for what I am trying to do.</p><p>I am going to slow down to speed up, and go back to pen and paper whenever I need to think about the best way to break a problem down.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I am still getting familiar with the SOLID principles and am trying to assess their value. It is often only when I see them in bad code that I have written or problems that I come up against after not implementing them that I can spot them.</p><p>But I think reading through them at this stage is a good exercise. The Open Close Principle is the next one I am looking at, which states, that software entities should be closed for modification but open for extension.</p><p>That is, that it should be possible to make changes to the exisiting code and extend its behaviour without breaking the exisiting functionality of the code. Interfaces help with this as they allow you to extend the code more easily and help create compact classes that hold the required behaviour.</p><p>I am using this principle to a certain degree without realising it, but will try and be more concious of when I am using it and make sure I do so when required.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>I am starting to really see the benefit of using fakes in my code. Working through a Guess the Number game and creating a fake that simulates the input and intermediate output is useful when writing tests because you need to be able to test behaviour that is not certain and can change each time a program is run.</p><p>The way this is done is through the use of an interface. An interface is essentially a class that contains the methods or behaviour that must be present for your class to work. The class that ultimately uses this behaviour is not aware of the behaviour of the object that implements the interface, provided that it contains the methods that the interface requires.</p><p>In the tests you can then create class that implements the methods or behaviour the interface requires, but set what they return to a value that is hardcoded. Then the actual console implementation can be passed in when the actual game is run so that the Fakes hardcoded returns can be replaced with a user input and the correct output.</p><p>Guess the number is a simple enough program to test this so this is a good way to start understanding IO and fakes in Java.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>While and Do While loops are two of the most common loops and they exist across most languages. A normal while loop executes the code inside it provided the boolean expression it evaluates is true.</p><p>It is easy to enter a never ending while loop accidently if you forget to include a terminating condition. So it is important to always consider if the condition that you want to exit the loop on is ever met. If it is not your program will never exit the loop or go past that point.</p><p>eg.</p><pre><code>while (true) 
    do (something)
 until (terminating condition)
</code></pre><p>A do while loop however, is that the code is always executed at least once, because the condition or expression is evaluated at the bottom of the loop. </p><p>This is an advantage in certain circumstances eg. if you need to make sure an output is printed at least once even if the condition within the while loop is not true.</p></div>
