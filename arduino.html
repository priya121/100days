      <div data-id="content"><p>Today Micah, the founder of 8th Light held his second day of the mastery cohort and all of us were kindly given an Arduino starter kit. I had wanted one for a while and it felt like an early Christmas present. </p><p>Arduino is a company that designs, manufactures and sells micro-contollers and micro-controller accessories. These allow you to connect to your computer and program various circuits and components. It was interesting to read through the introductory book that came with the starter kit and it reminded me of my GCSE Physics classes. </p><p>The first exercise was to build a simple series circuit and write up code that would cause a LED bulb to light up. We then connected a paralell circuit and made flashing lights that were supposed to look like a spaceship. It was cool to see how simple code would cause the electrical components to do what we wanted them to do. Well, most of the time anyway!</p><p>After lunch we attempted a Love Machine exercise that used a thermometer component to tell how “hot” you were, and also managed to get the keyboard exercise working with 3 simple musical notes. </p><p>It was a great introduction to how software connects to simple hardware and I am excited to try some more of the exercises out in my own time. One I have my eye on is the Crystal Ball, which looks more complex as there are many more connections that must align with specific parts of the digital display. Hopefully, I’ll manage to get it working and will be able to build on it once I do.</p></div>
