      <div data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language and it takes some getting used to when moving across from Ruby. This basically means that types have to be defined when you initially set them and cannot be changed at a later stage in an application or program. </p><p>This makes it more clear as to what is happening and provides more structure as less is hidden. The length of methods and simple statements are also therefore much longer than Ruby.</p><p>The Java koans are a good starting point and introduce basic Java tools (some used frequently and others not so much), but getting used to writing in a new language is the best way to learn it.</p></div>
