      <div data-id="content"><p>I was getting comfortable with deciding which objects should be separate in Ruby and starting to sense what they should and should not be doing. This was probably because I had built a few games and was starting to see the pattern of what should be separated out. </p><p>It is strange that when the syntax for something is new, even though the objects it represents might not be so different from another language, it feels different to think about how these objects should be separated out. Hopefully, with a bit of practice this will again start to become clear and the more I write, the clearer it will become.</p></div>
