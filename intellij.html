      <div data-id="content"><p>Starting to learn Java, Intellij is really a great tool. I have just migrated to using vim and it is clear I was really using Intellij for a lot of things I took for granted. Despite occassionally being stuck in CAPS LOCK it allowed me to learn how to set up a java project very quickly.</p><p>Java is really verbose and Intellij imports a lot of dependencies and autocompletes a lot and this was really useful, but hid a lot of what was going on and what Java requires to run.</p><p>I am still exploring the benefits of learning how to write Java in pure vim and feel like I am learning a lot. I will report back after I get more comfortable with Java in vim and can properly weigh up the benefits and drawbacks, but if you are starting to learn Java for the first time, I can’t recommend Intellij enough.</p></div>
