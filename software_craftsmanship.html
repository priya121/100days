      <div data-id="content"><p>I have just started reading Software Craftsmanship, it helps to know a little of the history of something you try and practice everyday. I knew that software can be a craft and I understand the importance of it. Mainly after having learnt the hard way (through finding problems, doing the opposite). </p><p>So what does a craft entail exactly? It is the combination of art and utility. That means it not only has to function well, but also look aesthetically nice. The history of why software design is described as engineering is discussed in the first chapters of the book and I highly recommend it, it is a fascinating read. </p></div>
