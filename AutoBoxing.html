      <div data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language, which means that every variable and every expression has a type that must be known at compile time.</p><p>Types limit the values a variable can hold or an expression can produce, but also help reduce errors in the long run.</p><p>So in Java, data is stored in the form of data types and every variable has a data type.</p><p>The data types in Java are split into two :-</p><p>primitive data types and object types/references</p><p>PRIMITIVE TYPES</p><p>The Java memory model specifies how the Java virtual machine works with the computer memory (RAM).</p><p>The value of a variable stored as a primitive type is typically stored in the memory location assigned to that variable on the thread stack</p><p>There are 8–predefined primitive by the language, here they are in order of increasing sizes and they are limited to those sizes:</p><p>“primitive” means a fundamental component that is used to create other, larger parts</p><p>When you create variable stored as a primitive type instead of creating an object on the heap, Java creates a kind of automatic variable that is not a reference. This variable holds the value directly and is placed on the stack making access more efficient.</p><p>int x = 3; &gt; this means at the memory location of x, 3 will be stored there</p><p>Primitive types also come in versions that are objects. Just capitalised and these have their own set of methods that can be called on them.</p><p>OBJECT TYPES</p><p>A variable of an object type is also called a reference. This is because the variable doesn’t contain the object, but contains a reference pointing to the object. These are stored in the heap.</p><p>The different object types in java are :</p><p>interface types, class types and array types</p><p>In order to create an object reference you must instantiate an object first so that you can manipulate it. So you don’t manipulate the object directly, but use a reference to the object. The reference to the object is like a remote control to the actual object the TV. So you can access the object by calling certain methods on the reference.</p><p>When you create an object in Java, it is stored on the heap. There is generally no limit to memory size in this area. To create an object on the heap, you would use the new keyword like this:-</p><p>eg. Integer myInteger = new Integer(45);</p><p>MEMORY MODEL</p><p>Primitive types and object types are stored within the Java Memory Model</p><p>A local variable (one not accessible by the class) may be of a primitive type, in which case it is kept on the thread stack.</p><p>A local variable may also be a reference to an object. In that case the reference (the local variable) is stored on the thread stack, but the object itself if stored on the heap.</p><p>An object may contain methods and these methods may contain local variables. These local variables are also stored on the thread stack.</p><p>The member variables of an object however, are stored on the heap along with the object itself. That is true both when the member variable is of a primitive type, and if it is a reference to an object. The heap contains all objects created in your Java application, regardless of what thread created the object.</p><p>AUTOBOXING</p><p>Before Java 5 you had to call a method on an object version of a primitive type in order to get the value</p><p>But with Java 5, Java automatically converts a primitive type like int into corresponding wrapper class object and unwraps an object if a primitive type is required</p><p>eg. ArrayList intList = new ArrayList(); intList.add(1); //autoboxing–primitive to object</p><p>int number = intList.get(0); // unboxing–object to primitive</p><p>Need to be careful, if you try to convert null to a primitive value you will get a NullPointerException</p><p>Integer myInteger = null; int myInt = myInteger;</p><p>Using operators and comparing values, and can also lead to unnecessary memory use.</p></div>
