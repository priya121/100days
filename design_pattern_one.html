      <div data-id="content"><p>I have heard about design patterns and their uses, how they are just tools that you can use to possibly improve your code. That they have their uses, but also their limitations.</p><p>But I think it is important to be aware of them at the very least and then decide whether or not you want to or should use them.</p><p>The first one I have come across at the classroom sessions we have daily is the Decorator Pattern that handles common instances by wrapping them within one another. </p><p>This is done in Java through the use of interfaces which I have implemented in my Guess the Number game. </p><p>This allows for the addition of new instances with slight variations that do not impact the original instance and so many different variations can be created easily and this makes extra requirements cleaner and easier to implement.</p><p>I think this was a good design pattern to start with, and something I can use in the code I am writing. </p></div>
