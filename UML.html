          <section data-id="content"><p>UML diagrams are commonly used when modelling for object oriented design programs. They are the graphical notation for drawing diagrams of software concepts.</p><p>Composite relationships are shown in a UML diagram by an arrow with one end a point and the other a diamond.</p><p>Inheritance is shown through a blank arrowhead and the arrows point in the direction that the inheritance flows from.</p><p>Class Icons are divided into three components, a class title, the variables and the functions and interfaces are shown by the &lt;&gt; notation.</p><p>It is always a good idea to draw up a UML before starting to write a program, and adjust it as you go.</p></section>
