          <section data-id="content"><p>Mathematics is not vital to knowing how to program, but it definitely helps if you are good at it. This is formal logic. If x then y is not the same as if y then x (a mistake people make all the time in everyday conversation). Counting in binary is simple if you imagine that all a computer has access to is 0 and 1 or on and off in an electrical circuit.</p><p>Because of this everything it reads has to be repreeneted in 0s and 1s. So this means that once it has used 0 and 1 to represent a number it can repetitively reuse 0 and 1 to add onto the end of a previous combination of 0 and 1. </p><p>This is best explained if you imagine that you can only count using the digits 0–10 and a–j once you have counted to 10 using the numbers in order to carry on 0a would represent 11 and 1a would be 21 etc. </p><p>In a similar way a computer uses 0s and 1s and combinations of these when it needs to add to a previous value.</p><p>The easiest way to calculate the binary value of a number is to divide a number by 2 and record the remainder value as part of the binary result until the number you are dividing is one.</p></section>
