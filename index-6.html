        <div data-id="content"><p>Enums in Java allow for a specific data type to be set as a list of predefined constants. Most of the time, these predefined constants represent constants in the real world, like days of the week or months in a year. These rarely change so can be set for the duration of a program and do not represent numeric values or textual data.</p><p>Enums in Java are type safe, meaning that they cannot be reassigned to another type once they have been set. It is also possible to set values for the enums and retrieve these by calling .values() on them.</p><p>They can be used somewhat recklessly when defining a type on a set of values, but used well can be useful.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I am getting used to while learning Java is Type Casting. Type Casting is the assignment of one type of variable to another type.</p><p>There are two different types of Type Casting in Java. The widening casting from byte up to double, including everything in between (these take up increasing amounts of memory) and narrowing casting (a decreasing amount of memory) from double down to byte, also including everything in between.</p><p>It is important that the type cast objects share the same type hierarchy, meaning that they have a parent child relationship between them. If this is not the case, the compiler will throw a ClassCastException. Narrowing casting needs to be explicitly set in that you need to be explicit in the type of casting required. </p><p>Type casting is mainly used to get access to fields and methods declared on a target type or class and I am sure I will be using more of them as I get more familiar with Java.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Coding Katas are a way of practicing muscle memory and approaching a simple problem in the simplest way possible. I have not attempted too many katas so far, but intend to do as many as I can going forwards. Two that I have approached are the roman numerals kata and the coin changer kata. The more you practice them the easier they become.</p><p>I am going to attempt to at least start one every morning. <a href="http://exercism.io/">This</a> is a great website that has a long list of different katas in different languages and the well-known <a href="http://www.codewars.com/about">CodeWars</a> is another that is fun and easy to use.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>There are many useful components in Ruby as a language and one I looked into closer recently is Encapsulation.</p><p>Encapsulation reduces coupling as it hides the internal representation or data structure of a particular object. This makes it easier to make changes when they become necessary, as if there are changes that need to be made to the data within the class, it will handle these changes and they will not have to be made throughout the entire program or application. </p><p>Encapsulation makes more sense when programs get larger, but I am going to try and implement it as soon as possible and this will make things easier to change.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Object Oriented Design (OOD) is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot in software design and it is easy to think of it as an extra addition to add to code if you have the luxury of time. But actually good OOD saves a lot of pain if ever you need to change a program later on in time.</p><p>One of the main components of good OO design is the correct flow of dependencies. A dependency is when one class requires another to work or uses another class in order to work (the first class is said to depend on the second). A UML diagram often helps to figure out what the correct flow of dependencies should be. If you can control the flow of dependencies and recognise which direction the flow should be directed you have the basis of understanding good Object Oriented Design.</p></div>
