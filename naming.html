      <div data-id="content"><p>One of the rules in Corey Haines’s book Four Rules of Simple Design is to express intent and one of the first ways he proposes to adhere to this rule is to have good names within your code.</p><p>This is easier said than done. I tend to have longer more descriptive names that will at least allow me to remember what they represent. But this often clutters up my code and I sometimes do not come back to change it. So it probably makes sense to spend that extra time thinking of a good representative name that anyone reading the code will be able to decipher.</p><p>This is as true of tests as it is of actual code. Tests should also be clear in their intent. Like everything in code, (much like everything in life!) it is all about trade offs, sometimes a more verbose name is neccessary, but can take up space, other times it is better to have concise names that do not capture the whole explanation of what the name represents. It is always good however, to take that little bit of extra time and think of the best name you can at that moment.</p></div>
