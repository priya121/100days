          <section data-id="content"><p>While and Do While loops are two of the most common loops and they exist across most languages. A normal while loop executes the code inside it provided the boolean expression it evaluates is true.</p><p>It is easy to enter a never ending while loop accidently if you forget to include a terminating condition. So it is important to always consider if the condition that you want to exit the loop on is ever met. If it is not your program will never exit the loop or go past that point.</p><p>eg.</p><pre><code>while (true) 
    do (something)
 until (terminating condition)
</code></pre><p>A do while loop however, is that the code is always executed at least once, because the condition or expression is evaluated at the bottom of the loop. </p><p>This is an advantage in certain circumstances eg. if you need to make sure an output is printed at least once even if the condition within the while loop is not true.</p><p>So next time you want to use a while loop, it is worth thinking about if it would make more sense to use a do while loop.</p></section>
