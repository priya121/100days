      <div data-id="content"><p>It really is amazing how humans can empathize with each other and even some other animals to an extent.</p><p>Like anything though, empathy is something that comes with practise. There is an element of imagination involved. JK Rowling, captures it well in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHGqp8lz36c">this</a> commencement speech she gave.</p><p>Empathy not only makes communicating with other people much easier, it allows you to learn so much more than you would otherwise. This is something that is especially handy when you are in a learning environment, and even when people say things you do not agree with. Most of the time, they do not intentionally mean to be malicious, they are just drawing on the sum of their experiences. That is not to say sometimes it can still be annoying! But it is easier to handle if you know <em>why</em> they think this way.</p><p>I know I was fortunate to meet a variety of people being born and living abroad for some time, having parents of a different culture and attending an international school, but it is easy, especially in a city like London, to meet people from a huge range of places.</p><p>Travel, must be one of the best ways to meet people from a background different to yours nand develop empathy. This of course is not the only way to develop empathy. Some people who have never travelled can be more empathetic than the most avid traveller, but if you are open-minded, meeting people whose upbringings and views are different to yours can only add to your knowledge and make your life much more interesting. I mean imagine a world where everyone was the same, what a beige and boring place to be.</p></div>
