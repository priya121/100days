        <div data-id="content"><p>The other day I helped a student apprentice with Ruby and it was strange going back to a dynamic language after focusing on Java for so long. Although it felt good not having the restrictions that Java has, I realised that it takes a little longer to understand what is going on if the names are not clear, and it is hard to keep track of what a variable represents as they can change back and forth so quickly. This is something that I should probably keep in mind when I go back to Ruby. Make the names incredibly clear and representative of what they are, or things can get confusing. I know I started with Ruby, but I think I might just prefer statically typed languages for now...</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Constructing tests and deciding where to start is difficult, especially at the very beginning. A useful place to start is the most basic use case, an empty array or string representing the final construction you want to start building. This is a good entry point and from there you can start building out what you want to construct step by step, closer to the final product.</p><p>A good practice, that is difficult to adpot, is to think about what your code would ideally look like on execution and write a test that reflects this. This is of course more difficult than you would imagine. Most of the time, even before a test has been written you have some idea of how you want to di this in code. I think it is a good idea to try and detach and try on just focus on the tests and go from there. This is something I know I definitely need to work on.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>The Liskov Principle was formulated by Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing in 1994. It was described by them as:</p><p>Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.</p><p>This essentially means that subtypes of a an object may replace the object itself, without totally changing the functioning of a program.</p><p>In java this is ususally implemented with the use of abstract classes and interfaces. </p><p>The typical example for this is the square and the rectangle, which I think does not illustrate the example very well. A much better expalination was given by one of the craftsmen during a Zagaku this week. Here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/8thlight/zagaku/blob/master/solid/lsp.md">Liskov</a>.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have always listened to music while I work. I always found it fun and eaiser to concentrate when I hd my headphones in and music on. I even remember holding a math statistics experiment (probably in an attempt to liten to more music whie I studied) that measured if I was more productive while working and listening to music. Now this probably was not the most scientific experiment and I am sure the results were skewed. But I found I was more productive when I listened to music. Of course the only way that I anyone can completely focus is in silence. There are times when I need this, but most of the time if I have some music on I find I can tune out my surroundings and focus.</p><p>I am going to try and spend some time listening to music and coding and spend some other dedicated time trying to code without music and see in which setting I am more productive. I suppose that eventually, there will be times when listening to music to focus is necessary and other times when I should try and refrain and not plug in.</p></div>
