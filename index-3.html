        <div data-id="content"><p>Constructing tests and deciding where to start is difficult, especially at the very beginning. A useful place to start is the most basic use case, an empty array or string representing the final construction you want to start building. This is a good entry point and from there you can start building out what you want to construct step by step, closer to the final product.</p><p>A good practice, that is difficult to adpot, is to think about what your code would ideally look like on execution and write a test that reflects this. This is of course more difficult than you would imagine. Most of the time, even before a test has been written you have some idea of how you want to di this in code. I think it is a good idea to try and detach and try on just focus on the tests and go from there. This is something I know I definitely need to work on.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>Today all the Apprentices and Craftsmen of the 8th Light London office attended a Leadership workshop and spent a few hours discussing what values we hold dear and which ones we would like to improve upon.</p><p>There was quite a bit of introspection involved, which was good. Sometimes when you are so busy it is difficult to find the time to pause and reflect. I usually use the time I run and exercise to do this, but I have fallen out of practice with it and am not running as regularly as I used to. So it was nice to have time dedicated to think about what I would like to personally aim for.</p><p>Something that came up for me quite frequently was quality, but really if you looked carefully at most of the results that came up frequently there was quite some room for interpretation. Quality to me can be applied to most areas of life. To me quality just means putting time and care into something, that leads to better results naturally. This can mean quality time with friends and family, quality in cooking a meal, quality in building a house, quality in a performance. It is again the aggregation of marginal gains and doing things with purpose. I am quite an excitable person, which definitely has its time and place but I would like to sometimes slow down and pay even more attention to detail which I am sure will help my work.</p><p>So this is what I personally got out of the workshop, I am going to take time to pause and reflect more and strive for quality and consideration in everything (well most things anyway!) that I do.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>The Liskov Principle was formulated by Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing in 1994. It was described by them as:</p><p>Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.</p><p>This essentially means that subtypes of a an object may replace the object itself, without totally changing the functioning of a program.</p><p>In java this is ususally implemented with the use of abstract classes and interfaces. </p><p>The typical example for this is the square and the rectangle, which I think does not illustrate the example very well. A much better expalination was given by one of the craftsmen during a Zagaku this week. Here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/8thlight/zagaku/blob/master/solid/lsp.md">Liskov</a>.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>As my minesweeper program is getting bigger and I am starting to think about the different classes that could emerge from the existing ones it already has, it is becoming increasingly important to think about <em>how</em> they should be separated. </p><p>I am currently reading Kent Beck’s Implementation Patterns and he describes the various categories of class separation and state. There are a lot of categories, and I think the only way to really fully understand their use is to actually use them in my code.</p><p>The ones I have come across already are Interfaces, and Superclasses to some extent. He also talks about specialization and the types of questions you should be asking if you want to think about how to separate out classes. Some patterns I have not really used yet are the Implementor pattern and the Inner Class.</p><p>Most of the state based patterns are concerned with how an object changes state. This is primarily done through the internals of the object, so all the methods it contains.</p><p>I am going to try and notice when I use these patterns in my code and write up how I am trying to use them.</p></div>
