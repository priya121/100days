      <div data-id="content"><p>I have been so focused on learning TDD and trying my best to stick to it I never really considered there were other ways of testing. BDD is the topic ofa Clean Coders video I watched this week and it was interesting to think of the need for business to be able to write specifications that programmers can write in. </p><p>Like so many industries it is the differences in terminology that really leads to miscommunication, so finding words that are understood by all is important. Of course terminology is there for a reason, it is always more concise and saves time. But for something to be useful outside of an industry, it is important to at least be able to communicate something simply. I think that is why Einstein said: If you cannot explain it simply enough, you do not understand it well enough. </p><p>It is similar to the idea that a problem must be broken down into its most basic components in order for any computation. If you want a person who is not in your industry, or a programmer you need to be able to break the words down into simple non-technical words for them to be able to understand, and this is only achievable through practice. </p></div>
