      <div data-id="content"><p>Writing clean code definitley becomes easier as you get better at writing code and your knowledge of what is possible grows. But making sure you write cleanly as you go is more about discipline. I have to reduce all the methods in my Minesweeper down to three methods which is quite tricky and is getting trickier as I am putting it off. I think it would actually have been better to start with small methods, refactoring at every possible stage and keep everything cleanly separated. So going forward, I am definitely going to start by keeping my methods short and saving myself the pain of refactoring so that I keep my code as clean as possible from the start.</p></div>
