      <div data-id="content"><p>It always amazes me how many analogies to life can come from running a marathon. One of them is definitely to find your own pace and stick to it. It is easy to get carried away at the beginning of the race, especially when there are others around you hurtling past, but staying focused on your own pace and knowing what your limits are is really important to being able to finish.</p><p>In the opposite sense, with Christmas round the corner and everything seemingly slowing down up to Christmas and New Year, it is easy to slow down along with everyone, but I still feel like I have a lot to do. So I am going to do stick to my pace and carry on learning through the holiday season, even when it is easy to feel like nobody is really working on anything! Of course I’ll be sure to enjoy the occasional mince pie and take time to see family and friends, but I’ll do my best to keep up my focus and pace the rest of the time.</p></div>
