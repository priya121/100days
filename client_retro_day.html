      <div data-id="content"><p>Today I spent the day at a client site and helped facilitate a retrospective in which the participants talked about all the things they learnt over the five weeks during which they built their product.</p><p>It was fun and it was great to see them able to demo their product well. It was also interesting that at one point they mentioned that they were concerned with how the final product looked more than the code underlying it. This can happen quite easily when you want to show something to people who do not understand code very well. But to people who know what lies beneath the user interface the structure and quality of the code is equally if not more important.</p><p>I got the impression that the 8th Light effect rubbed off on them, and they all seemed to really get along well and enjoy what they were doing. The fact that it was their final day might have been a contributing factor, but I hope they can carry their enthusiasm with them when they go on to their new projects and new teams.</p></div>
