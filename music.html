      <div data-id="content"><p>I have always listened to music while I work. I always found it fun and eaiser to concentrate when I hd my headphones in and music on. I even remember holding a math statistics experiment (probably in an attempt to liten to more music whie I studied) that measured if I was more productive while working and listening to music. Now this probably was not the most scientific experiment and I am sure the results were skewed. But I found I was more productive when I listened to music. Of course the only way that I anyone can completely focus is in silence. There are times when I need this, but most of the time if I have some music on I find I can tune out my surroundings and focus.</p><p>I am going to try and spend some time listening to music and coding and spend some other dedicated time trying to code without music and see in which setting I am more productive. I suppose that eventually, there will be times when listening to music to focus is necessary and other times when I should try and refrain and not plug in.</p></div>
