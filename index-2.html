        <div data-id="content"><p>It really is amazing how humans can empathize with each other and even some other animals to an extent.</p><p>Like anything though, empathy is something that comes with practise. There is an element of imagination involved. JK Rowling, captures it well in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHGqp8lz36c">this</a> commencement speech she gave.</p><p>Empathy not only makes communicating with other people much easier, it allows you to learn so much more than you would otherwise. This is something that is especially handy when you are in a learning environment, and even when people say things you do not agree with. Most of the time, they do not intentionally mean to be malicious, they are just drawing on the sum of their experiences. That is not to say sometimes it can still be annoying! But it is easier to handle if you know <em>why</em> they think this way.</p><p>I know I was fortunate to meet a variety of people being born and living abroad for some time, having parents of a different culture and attending an international school, but it is easy, especially in a city like London, to meet people from a huge range of places.</p><p>Travel, must be one of the best ways to meet people from a background different to yours nand develop empathy. This of course is not the only way to develop empathy. Some people who have never travelled can be more empathetic than the most avid traveller, but if you are open-minded, meeting people whose upbringings and views are different to yours can only add to your knowledge and make your life much more interesting. I mean imagine a world where everyone was the same, what a beige and boring place to be.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Pair programming can be a lot of fun. I am quite a social person and enjoy sitting with someone to solve a problem. The thing with code is that it can be tackled in so many different ways and it takes some level of compromise to work with someone as they might not think in the same way you do.</p><p>This can be quite tiring, and pair programming is tiring, but incredibly useful. You can learn new things in a practical way and learn how to think laterally.</p><p>Typically there is a driver (who handles the tactical/typing part of the coding) and a navigator (who thinks about the overall strategy). These roles of course switch regularly when ping pong programming.</p><p>Some tips that are useful to think about when pair programming that we covered in our Zagaku lesson today were:</p><ol><li><p>Set the ground rules before you start. (If checking phones or emails is alright, when you both agree to take breaks, how long you want to pair etc.)</p></li><li><p>Decide on the type of pair programming style you would like to adopt. The style we tend to practice the most at 8th light is ping pong. This is where one person writes a test, then the next writes code to make the test pass. Finally, the first person again has to refactor if possible to make the code better.</p></li><li><p>Ensure you have a comfortable set up, ideally with one screen and one or two keyboards.</p></li><li><p>Communication is the key factor, make sure you communicate clearly for the duration of your pair programming session.</p></li></ol><p>Pairing can seem daunting when you are inexperienced, but I think everyone hopefully gets something out of it, so I am going to try and pair daily and recommend you do to!</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing code definitely becomes muscle memory the more you write and type. That is probably why going through a kata becomes so much easier the more you practice it. That is also why the best way to learn a new language is just to practice it and get a feel for what the best practices and style conventions for it are.</p><p>I suppose it is not groundbreaking that the more you practice something the easier it becomes. I have found this is especially true and measurable with exercise, which I definitely have fallen out of practice with.</p><p>Like committing to building something in order to ensure you learn a new language, I think I’ll sign up to a race in order to get back into the habit of exercise.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing clean code definitley becomes easier as you get better at writing code and your knowledge of what is possible grows. But making sure you write cleanly as you go is more about discipline. I have to reduce all the methods in my Minesweeper down to three methods which is quite tricky and is getting trickier as I am putting it off. I think it would actually have been better to start with small methods, refactoring at every possible stage and keep everything cleanly separated. So going forward, I am definitely going to start by keeping my methods short and saving myself the pain of refactoring so that I keep my code as clean as possible from the start.</p></div>
