          <section data-id="content"><p>Arrays in Ruby are incredibly useful and most of the tasks and programs that I built while I was learning Ruby had an array within them at some point or another. As I learn more Java I’m sure that arrays will be increasingly useful, (I have already used some briefly in some of the katas that I am practicing).</p><p>Arrays in Java must be created using an array creation expression. </p><p>e.g. new type[length] </p><p>The type must be explicitly set as everything must be in Java. Similar to Ruby different elements can be accessed using array[i] where i is the index number of the element trying to be accessed.</p><p>It is also possible to create multi-dimensional arrays by writing type [] [], type [] [] [] etc.</p><p>There are also no array constants, new arrays are created every time an array initialiser is evaluated. </p><p>Despite there being these restrictions on arrays in Java, by using class Arrays in java.util certain utility methods are available that allow you manipulate the array.</p></section>
