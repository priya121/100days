        <div data-id="content"><p>There are many useful components in Ruby as a language and one I looked into closer recently is Encapsulation.</p><p>Encapsulation reduces coupling as it hides the internal representation or data structure of a particular object. This makes it easier to make changes when they become necessary, as if there are changes that need to be made to the data within the class, it will handle these changes and they will not have to be made throughout the entire program or application. </p><p>Encapsulation makes more sense when programs get larger, but I am going to try and implement it as soon as possible and this will make things easier to change.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Object Oriented Design (OOD) is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot in software design and it is easy to think of it as an extra addition to add to code if you have the luxury of time. But actually good OOD saves a lot of pain if ever you need to change a program later on in time.</p><p>One of the main components of good OO design is the correct flow of dependencies. A dependency is when one class requires another to work or uses another class in order to work (the first class is said to depend on the second). A UML diagram often helps to figure out what the correct flow of dependencies should be. If you can control the flow of dependencies and recognise which direction the flow should be directed you have the basis of understanding good Object Oriented Design.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Setting up a new machine can take time and it is always nice to take your time customizing the settings just how you like them. But this can take a long time if there are many settings you have to set manually. A useful way to speed up this process and cut down duplication time is to copy across your dotfiles from git.</p><p>I recently did this and now am able to quickly work on my projects on the new machine just as I did before. In order to clone across the files, it is also necessary to set up your new machine with an SSH key on git. There are many resources that help with this. One I used is: [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/] and it is a simple process.</p><p>Now I can manage my settings across multiple devices and am more comfortable with adding to my dotfiles. Next step is to change my vim colours!</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language and it takes some getting used to when moving across from Ruby. This basically means that types have to be defined when you initially set them and cannot be changed at a later stage in an application or program. </p><p>This makes it more clear as to what is happening and provides more structure as less is hidden. The length of methods and simple statements are also therefore much longer than Ruby.</p><p>The Java koans are a good starting point and introduce basic Java tools (some used frequently and others not so much), but getting used to writing in a new language is the best way to learn it.</p></div>
