      <div data-id="content"><p>Pair programming can be a lot of fun. I am quite a social person and enjoy sitting with someone to solve a problem. The thing with code is that it can be tackled in so many different ways and it takes some level of compromise to work with someone as they might not think in the same way you do.</p><p>This can be quite tiring, and pair programming is tiring, but incredibly useful. You can learn new things in a practical way and learn how to think laterally.</p><p>Typically there is a driver (who handles the tactical/typing part of the coding) and a navigator (who thinks about the overall strategy). These roles of course switch regularly when ping pong programming.</p><p>Some tips that are useful to think about when pair programming that we covered in our Zagaku lesson today were:</p><ol><li><p>Set the ground rules before you start. (If checking phones or emails is alright, when you both agree to take breaks, how long you want to pair etc.)</p></li><li><p>Decide on the type of pair programming style you would like to adopt. The style we tend to practice the most at 8th light is ping pong. This is where one person writes a test, then the next writes code to make the test pass. Finally, the first person again has to refactor if possible to make the code better.</p></li><li><p>Ensure you have a comfortable set up, ideally with one screen and one or two keyboards.</p></li><li><p>Communication is the key factor, make sure you communicate clearly for the duration of your pair programming session.</p></li></ol><p>Pairing can seem daunting when you are inexperienced, but I think everyone hopefully gets something out of it, so I am going to try and pair daily and really recommend you do to!</p></div>
