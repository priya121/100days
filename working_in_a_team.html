      <div data-id="content"><p>Something I have done little of is looking at code written by other people. Yesterday I paired with another apprentice and looked at code written by someone else. This would have been quite difficult to do alone and was the first time I tried to understand some code written by someone else. It was good that I had someone who had done it before to guide me and we could look and discuss it together. I did make some mistakes with git and had to repeat a few things, but this actually made me learn the process a bit better. </p><p>Another learning point was to maybe look at the whole code/ class before we started to make changes as this would have made our lives easier in the long term (if we understood how the different methods interelated). I also saw that my naming was not very good, and that I should communicate what changes that I am making with clear messages. I suppose it was the first time I considered other people would be reading my git who were not completely aware of what I was working on. So I am going to try and redo my GuessTheNumber game in Java using frequent pull requests and commit to Git regularly. </p></div>
