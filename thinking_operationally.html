      <div data-id="content"><p>When I started to write a Battleship game earlier this year, I started with how I imagine I would build an actual game board if it was a physical object. Board does not really concern itself with the rules of the game and so even though this seems like a good place to start, it is better to first think about what the rules and operations of the game are and go from there.</p><p>It’s easy to approach most games/katas by thinking about a board or any of the physical parts of a task, as these seem like the obvious places to start building, but by doing it this way much more code needs to be written and it actually complicates a task. I am going to start thinking more operationally and hopefully this will force a better approach to writing more concise code.</p></div>
