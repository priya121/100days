        <div data-id="content"><p>Pair programming can be a lot of fun. I am quite a social person and enjoy sitting with someone to solve a problem. The thing with code is that it can be tackled in so many different ways and it takes some level of compromise to work with someone as they might not think in the same way you do.</p><p>This can be quite tiring, and pair programming is tiring, but incredibly useful. You can learn new things in a practical way and learn how to think laterally.</p><p>Typically there is a driver (who handles the tactical/typing part of the coding) and a navigator (who thinks about the overall strategy). These roles of course switch regularly when ping pong programming.</p><p>Some tips that are useful to think about when pair programming that we covered in our Zagaku lesson today were:</p><ol><li><p>Set the ground rules before you start. (If checking phones or emails is alright, when you both agree to take breaks, how long you want to pair etc.)</p></li><li><p>Decide on the type of pair programming style you would like to adopt. The style we tend to practice the most at 8th light is ping pong. This is where one person writes a test, then the next writes code to make the test pass. Finally, the first person again has to refactor if possible to make the code better.</p></li><li><p>Ensure you have a comfortable set up, ideally with one screen and one or two keyboards.</p></li><li><p>Communication is the key factor, make sure you communicate clearly for the duration of your pair programming session.</p></li></ol><p>Pairing can seem daunting when you are inexperienced, but I think everyone hopefully gets something out of it, so I am going to try and pair daily and really recommend you do to!</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing code definitely becomes muscle memory the more you write and type. That is probably why going through a kata becomes so much easier the more you practice it. That is also why the best way to learn a new language is just to practice it and get a feel for what the best practices and style conventions for it are.</p><p>I suppose it is not groundbreaking that the more you practice something the easier it becomes. I have found this is especially true and measurable with exercise, which I definitely have fallen out of practice with.</p><p>Like committing to building something in order to ensure you learn a new language, I think I’ll sign up to a race in order to get back into the habit of exercise.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing clean code definitley becomes easier as you get better at writing code and your knowledge of what is possible grows. But making sure you write cleanly as you go is more about discipline. I have to reduce all the methods in my Minesweeper down to three methods which is quite tricky and is getting trickier as I am putting it off. I think it would actually have been better to start with small methods, refactoring at every possible stage and keep everything cleanly separated. So going forward, I am definitely going to start by keeping my methods short and saving myself the pain of refactoring so that I keep my code as clean as possible from the start.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>As Java documentation explains, a class is like a blueprint that can be used to create an object. Each time an object is created by calling new ObjectName an object constructed with the relevant constructors. </p><pre><code>Square square = new Square(50,50);
</code></pre><p>A class can have multiple constructors, and it is possible to create variations of an object by using these different constructors (if teh constructors are different they must have different signatures. A constructor has the same name as the class and has no return type.</p><pre><code>
public class Shape {

    public Shape(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public void areaOfSquare() {
        return width * height;
    }

        <div data-id="content"><p>Constructing tests and deciding where to start is difficult, especially at the very beginning. A useful place to start is the most basic use case, an empty array or string representing the final construction you want to start building. This is a good entry point and from there you can start building out what you want to construct step by step, closer to the final product.</p><p>A good practice, that is difficult to adpot, is to think about what your code would ideally look like on execution and write a test that reflects this. This is of course more difficult than you would imagine. Most of the time, even before a test has been written you have some idea of how you want to di this in code. I think it is a good idea to try and detach and try on just focus on the tests and go from there. This is something I know I definitely need to work on.</p></div>
