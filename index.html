        <div data-id="content"><p>I have just started reading Software Craftsmanship, it helps to know a little of the history of something you try and practice everyday. I knew that software can be a craft and I understand the importance of it. Mainly after having learnt the hard way (through finding problems, doing the opposite). </p><p>So what does a craft entail exactly? It is the combination of art and utility. That means it not only has to function well, but also look aesthetically nice. The history of why software design is described as engineering is discussed in the first chapters of the book and I highly recommend it, it is a fascinating read. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Polymorphism is one of the greatest advantages of OOP (object oriented desin). It basically means you can call different methods on an object and change its form.</p><p>This allows you to create many categories of an object. In Java all objects are polymorphic, because they are all part of the class Object.</p><p>A class can gave different underlying data, but can be presented in the same form as others due to polymorphism.</p><p>Polymorphism is a real advantage to OOP and even though I was not sure what the definition was, I have been using it a lot already.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have heard about design patterns and their uses, how they are just tools that you can use to possibly improve your code. That they have their uses, but also their limitations.</p><p>But I think it is important to be aware of them at the very least and then decide whether or not you want to or should use them.</p><p>The first one I have come across at the classroom sessions we have daily is the Decorator Pattern that handles common instances by wrapping them within one another. </p><p>This is done in Java through the use of interfaces which I have implemented in my Guess the Number game. </p><p>This allows for the addition of new instances with slight variations that do not impact the original instance and so many different variations can be created easily and this makes extra requirements cleaner and easier to implement.</p><p>I think this was a good design pattern to start with, I am going to work my way through the patterns and try and experiment with my code by adding them in.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>One of the things I am trying to get better at is writing concise code and a great way to do this is by reducing duplication. Initially I find that I write a lot of if statements as these are the closest to real language that I use when describing the problem or visualizing it for the first time.</p><p>Sometimes this duplication is more subtle than I would like and an alorithm is hiding in there somewhere. This is difficult to do once you have started o write, but again I think an old pen and paper helps. Sometimes, it takes a little time to find the pattern and additional tests help with finding the commonalities for different combinations of input. </p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>I am starting to really see the benefit of using fakes in my code. Working through a Guess the Number game and creating a fake that simulates the input and intermediate output is useful when writing tests because you need to be able to test behaviour that is not certain and can change each time a program is run.</p><p>The way this is done is through the use of an interface. An interface is essentially a class that contains the methods or behaviour that must be present for your class to work. The class that ultimately uses this behaviour is not aware of the behaviour of the object that implements the interface, provided that it contains the methods that the interface requires.</p><p>In the tests you can then create class that implements the methods or behaviour the interface requires, but set what they return to a value that is hardcoded. Then the actual console implementation can be passed in when the actual game is run so that the Fakes hardcoded returns can be replaced with a user input and the correct output.</p><p>Guess the number is a simple enough program to test this so this is a good way to start understanding IO and fakes in Java.</p></div>
