        <div data-id="content"><p>Testing and knowing what to test can be tough when you begin to code. Starting with a degenerate case is a good approach but sometimes this can lead to testing implementation details that can change as your code evolves. This is where black box testing comes in. Here you only test the public methods that handle the overall functionality and behaviour you want from a piece of code. White box testing is where you test the internals of a class or individual methods that handle small pieces of behaviour that you eventually want to hide as private methods.</p><p>I know I am guilty of writing simple and small tests that test individual functions and I tend not to change these to black box tests even when I know I no longer need them. I am going to keep in mind the advantages of black box testing and try and think of the overall functionality I want to test more going forward.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Starting to learn Java, Intellij is really a great tool. I have just migrated to using vim and it is clear I was really using Intellij for a lot of things I took for granted. Despite occassionally being stuck in CAPS LOCK it allowed me to learn how to set up a java project very quickly.</p><p>Java is really verbose and Intellij imports a lot of dependencies and autocompletes a lot and this was really useful, but hid a lot of what was going on and what Java requires to run.</p><p>I am still exploring the benefits of learning how to write Java in pure vim and feel like I am learning a lot. I will report back after I get more comfortable with Java in vim and can properly weigh up the benefits and drawbacks, but if you are starting to learn Java for the first time, I can’t recommend Intellij enough.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I thought I knew what functional programming was but I was wrong! I suppose I need to take one step at a time and I am sure during my apprenticeship I will eventually come to learn a functional language, but there is no harm in knowing the basics. So I thought I would share what I came across.</p><p>A functional language is a language that avoid mutating or changing data. It really helps break a problem down into its component parts. So you would just create new data structures instead of changing ones that already exist.</p><p>Functional programs are required to also be stateless, that is they should perform every task as if they were performing them for the first time. This is a pretty different way of thinking and I have just got my head around object oriented (OO) programming so am glad I will tackle functional programming once I have a bit more practice at writing OO languages.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Recursion can be a tricky concept and I know I definitely struggled with it when I first started learning how to code. But it is simply a method calling itself with changing parameters that causes it to recurse. This can often be accomplished by a while loop which actually creates fewer stack frames, but can be a less elegant way of tackling a simple problem.</p><p>So the main driving factor as far as I can see is the clarity of your code and the length of your program (including how much data it needs to analyze and compute).</p><p>This is a great <a href="http://roman01la.github.io/recursion-exercises/">webiste</a> that has a lot of great mini examples and ways to practice recursion.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Git is actually quite an amazing tool. I am aware I use it to a fraction of its capacity, but even the idea that so much code is open for anyone to see is inspired.</p><p>I recently helped organize an open source workshop to encourage others to learn how to collaborate with others and create pull requests. It was called @24pullrequests and the idea behind @24pullrequests is that everyday in December leading up to Christmas you submit a pull request on an open source project that has some issues.</p><p>There was even a table of new Java developers who could not find a project to contribute to so I helped them create a pull request for my Minesweeper game! I hope I can create more pull requests and get other people to contribute to my issues. I suppose the first step to this however would be to have small and regular commits so that anyone who actually wants to find certain functionality won’t have to wade through my code so they can help. So this a reminder to myself and others, make regular commits and make pull requests!</p></div>
