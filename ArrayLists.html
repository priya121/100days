          <section data-id="content"><p>Difference between an Array List and Array in Java</p><p>In Java Arrays and ArrayLists are differentiated in some important aspects:</p><ol><li><p>An Array is fixed in length, whereas the ArrayList can be added to and is dynamic in size.</p></li><li><p>ArrayLists cannot contain primitive data types whereas an Array can contain both Object references and primitive types.</p></li><li><p>.iterator can be used to iterate through an ArrayList, whereas a for or while loop can be used to iterate through an Array.</p></li><li><p>The length of an ArrayList is provided by the .size() method whereas .length is needed to determine the length of an array.</p></li><li><p>Elements can be added to an ArrayList using .add() and must be inserted using assignment for an Array.</p></li><li><p>An array can be multi-dimensional, but ArrayLists must always be one dimensional.</p></li></ol><p>This is another example of how careful consideration must be given to setting a type before it is declared in Java. Once it is clear what the requirements of the array are, which requires some foresight, a choice can be made between Array or ArrayList.</p></section>
