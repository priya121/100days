      <div data-id="content"><p>Today all the Apprentices and Craftsmen of the 8th Light London office attended a Leadership workshop and spent a few hours discussing what values we hold dear and which ones we would like to improve upon.</p><p>There was quite a bit of introspection involved, which was good. Sometimes when you are so busy it is difficult to find the time to pause and reflect. I usually use the time I run and exercise to do this, but I have fallen out of practice with it and am not running as regularly as I used to. So it was nice to have time dedicated to think about what I would like to personally aim for.</p><p>Something that came up for me quite frequently was quality, but really if you looked carefully at most of the results that came up frequently there was quite some room for interpretation. Quality to me can be applied to most areas of life. To me quality just means putting time and care into something, that leads to better results naturally. This can mean quality time with friends and family, quality in cooking a meal, quality in building a house, quality in a performance. It is again the aggregation of marginal gains and doing things with purpose. I am quite an excitable person, which definitely has its time and place but I would like to sometimes slow down and pay even more attention to detail which I am sure will help my work.</p><p>So this is what I personally got out of the workshop, I am going to take time to pause and reflect more and strive for quality and consideration in everything (well most things anyway!) that I do.</p></div>
