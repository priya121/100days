      <div data-id="content"><p>Next week I will be going along to visit a client site and see the final projects of their graduate intake. I am really excited to see what the graduates have learnt and see if there is anything I can help with. I have to say, I am glad that I am not going alone and that other craftsmen and an apprentice will also be going.</p><p>Dealing with a client is something I am fairly familiar with from my previous legal training, but I am interested to see how different it is when you consult and train with code. I am also keen to see how much of 8th Light has rubbed off on the graduates and excited to see their final products and demos. I will write up how I found the day and what I learnt after the retrospective that day.</p></div>
