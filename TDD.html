      <div data-id="content"><p>I was talking to someone at a workshop who used the comparison of TDD with a religion. The reason given for this was that there is no definitive study that shows code written using TDD is better than that not using it. So it is mainly faith that causes people to use TDD. Now I have researched this a little and I know it is not true. There are scientific studies that prove the benefits so I mist remember to show him.</p><p>The idea of TDD is to write a test for some behaviour you expect, run the test to see it fail, write as little code as possible to see the test pass and then refactor if possible when the test is green. The next steps are to repeat this process until all the behaviour you want in your program has been tested effectively. </p><p>I feel the benefit of using TDD even in the small katas and programs that I am writing as I learn more. So I am going to keep using tests before I write, even though I have some way to go in learning which tests to start with for some problems. Hopefully this will come with practice. </p></div>
